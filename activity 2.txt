1.Write a blog on difference between document and window objects


(i)Document represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser, 
window represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   
(ii)Document is loaded inside the window, 
window is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
(iii)Document is the object of window property,
 window is the object of the browser.
(iv)All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document,
Global objects, functions and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
(v)We can access the document from a window using the window. document, 
whereas We can access the window from  the window only. i.e. window.window
(vi)The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
(vii)Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
The difference between document and window objects can be illustrated with the help of the following example:

syntax:

      document.propertyname;

syntax:

      window.propertyname;

example:

     document.title :  will return the title of the document

example:

      window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
